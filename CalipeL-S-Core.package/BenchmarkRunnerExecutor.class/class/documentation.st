  Replace 'Object', 'NewClass1' and
  the empty string arguments by true values.
 
  Install (or change) the class by 'accepting',
  either via the menu or the keyboard (usually CMD-A).
 
  You can also change the category simply by editing
  the categoryString and accepting.
 
  To be nice to others (and yourself later), do not forget to
  add some documentation; preferably under the classes documentation
  protocol.
  (see the `create documentation stubs' item in the methodList menu;
   switch from instance to class to find this menu item.)
 
  Notice, that ST/X uses the convention to document the class using
  comment-only class methods (however, ST80 comments are supported and
  can be changed via the class-documentation menu).
 
 
 
  Notice: 
	the above text has been extracted from the classes documentation method.
	Any change in it will be lost if you 'accept' here.
	To change the documentation, switch to the documentation method and 'accept' any changes there.
